        <p>
            ODC Italia is an Italian brand created by Oriana Di Caro. </p>
            <p>Oriana, who loves accessories and good quality got inspired after a trip in Florence and decided that she had to share
these amazing products at least with her friends in NYC where she lives. The feedback was so promising that she has
adventured to start her own business importing leather bags. She personally goes to the factory in Florence and
handpicks piece by piece checking the manufacturing quality for each of them. Oriana is very picky when it comes to
the finishes and she makes sure only the best pieces come to New York.</p> 

<p>As you all probably already know, Florentine tradition of working leather dates back into antiquity. Due to the
proximity of the Arno river, providing an endless supply of water necessary for the tanning process, Florence and other
small towns bordering the river became important sources of high quality leather. Today’s market encourages these
artisans to produce an exceptionally soft and supple leather while exploring different textures, embossing and colors.
This means that the buyer is constantly accosted with new options, styles and more importantly prices.</p>
<p>Italian by birth, Oriana considers herself citizen of the world. She has lived in some of the most amazing cities, to name few: Rome, Sydney, Miami and now New York.
Wherever she has been she has noticed the same pattern: women love accessories and quality. If this comes
at a good price than BINGO! </p>

<p>ODC.Italia brings you Italian made handbags. In each bag you will ﬁnd the exaltation of femininity, with captivating
charm, which aims to enhance the shapes and passions of each woman. Every time Oriana begins a new project she
gives 100%. She always brings passion, determination and enthusiasm into the mix alongside her original ideas.</p> 

<p>The more she explores this fashion world, the more her attention to details increases, the more she falls in love passionately with accessories.</p>
